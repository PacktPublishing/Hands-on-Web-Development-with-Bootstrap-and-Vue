## About the Video Course
Bootstrap-Vue provides one of the most comprehensive implementations of Bootstrap 4’s components and grid system for Vue.js. Together, both of these tools help designers and developers create stunning applications.
In this course, you’ll be exploring how to integrate Bootstrap with Vue.js using Bootstrap-Vue by building a web app on Vue.js. Bootstrap-Vue not only supports the Bootstrap components and grid system but also includes support for Vue.js Directives.
We’ll start working with both tools to create a friendly, practical, and responsive user interface. You’ll learn how to make your UI look prettier by writing SASS and then you’ll finally package your app using Webpack.
By the end, you’ll be confident and equipped with Bootstrap-Vue to build amazing-looking applications that are responsive by default and create stunning applications that will wow users.
